# Airlines Data Analysis using python and SQL
## Aim
The goal of this data analysis project using SQL would be to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increased profitability for the airlines.

## Bussiness Problem
Our company has been providing high-quality air transportation service to our clients for several years, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. We operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. However, we currently face challenges due to various factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor costs. These challenges are putting pressure on the company's profitability, and we are actively seeking solutions to address this issue. In order to tackle this challenge, the company is planning to analyze their database and identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned per seat.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, airlines can maximize profitability by analyzing revenue data and making informed decisions. Factors such as total revenue, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft play a crucial role in this analysis. By identifying areas for improvement, adjusting pricing strategies, and optimizing routes, airlines can increase their profitability. However, it's important for airlines to consider consumer happiness and safety while striving for profit. Balancing these factors is key to long-term success in the competitive airline industry. Adopting a data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization can lead to sustainable growth and success.
